#### Build and play your own instrument and record your performances.

sample-jam makes use of the Web Audio API and RecorderJS to capture short audio samples from the user, which can then be played with the keyboard.  Once logged in, users can also save a set of samples, load them later on, and make and download recordings of the sampler.
