BACKLOG

- Record audio
  - Active/Inactive classes on record button
- Let user choose where audio will go
  - On record, grab select.val from dropdown
- Correctly route audio
  - Maybe each module should already have a hidden <audio> element, just modify its source.
- Keyboard listeners on modules
  - Quick spike on keypress event to determine keycodes
- Clear module
- Click listeners on modules
- Color animation on modules
- Recording/playback optimization
  - Don't want to hear button click, playing the 'instrument' needs to feel good.

IF ALL OF THE ABOVE IS HAPPENING...

- Before going through the authentication process, see if you can actually save the recordings to Db.
- If yes, do the users thing.

IF NO TIME

- Lose the user buttons!
