XXX Record audio
  XXX Active/Inactive classes on record button
XXX Let user choose where audio will go
  XXX On record, grab select.val from dropdown
XXX Correctly route audio
  XXX Maybe each module should already have a hidden <audio> element, just modify its source.
XXX Keyboard listeners on modules
  XXX Quick spike on keypress event to determine keycodes
XXX Clear module
  XXX CSS hover transition on clear button
- Click listeners on modules
  Use ElementChild??
- Color animation on modules
- Recording/playback optimization
  - Don't want to hear button click, playing the 'instrument' needs to feel good.
  - Can keypress interrupt playback and play again?  This would make it waaaay more fun to play.

IF ALL OF THE ABOVE IS HAPPENING...

- Before going through the authentication process, see if you can actually save the recordings to Db.
- If yes, do the users thing.

IF NO TIME

- Lose the user buttons!


THOUGHTS ON SAMPLER BEHAVIOR

When a module button is clicked OR corresponding key is pressed...
  - Play that module's audio
  - Change that button's class so it 'lights up' in a badass way

  KEYPRESSES
  - Object with keyCodes as keys, mod1-mod8 as values???
  - On keypress, check if e.keyCode matches one from object
  - If it does, do play and class change (with setTimeout to change back)
